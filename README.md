### Introduction

When two genetically distinct fungal strains make a hyphal contact (fuse) this triggers a cell death. Multiple fused hyphae along the line of the contact form a separation line made out of the dead hyphae. This searation line is called barrage. Its primary function is to separate genetically distinct strains to prevent the exchange of cellular content.  

Here we make an attempt to understand the molecular processes that control allorecognition in *C. parasitica*, chestnut blight felamentous fungus. 

- What triggers cell death in incompatible hyphae?
- What genes play major role?
- What are underlying processes?

### Strains

In this work we use three strains of *C. parasitica* incompatible by *vic3* locus. Strains P74-3 and EP155 are of distinct genetic background, but carry identical alleles at all *vic* loci except for *vic3*. The EP155 strain carries the *vic3-1* haplotype and P74-3 carries the *vic3-2* haplotype. Strain DZ-66 is derived from EP155 where genes *vic3a-1* and *vic3b-1* were knocked out
Strains list and original samples codes used for sequencing in FASTQ file names:

- E = EP155 (DK80 - non-homologous-end-joining knockout)
- P = P74-3 (wildtype)
- D = DZ-66 ($\Delta\Delta vic3$ - double *vic3* knockout of DK80)
- X = EP155 + P74-3 (mix)
- Z = DZ-66 + P74-3 (mix)

### Experiment

We developed a blending technique that allows to maximise the number of contacts formed when two incompatible strains are co-inoculated together. 

Three monoculture samples (EP155, P74-3, DZ-66) were used as controls. Two barrage samples were created by mixing  equal volumes of monoculture suspensions of incompatible strains (EP155 vs. P74-3 and DZ-66 vs. P74-3). Barrage sample with vic3 knockouts (DZ-66 vs. P74-3) was also used as a control in further analyses.
